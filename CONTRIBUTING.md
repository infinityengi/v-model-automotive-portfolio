# Contributing

Thanks for contributing! Short rules:

1. Fork -> feature branch -> PR to `main`. Use semantic commit messages (e.g., `chore(docs): ...`, `feat(case-study): ...`).
2. Create an issue or link your PR to an existing issue. Use labels (epic/feature/bug/chore/documentation).
3. Add tests for new behavior and update docs accordingly.
4. All PRs require at least 1 approval and passing CI (branch protection enabled).

See `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` for behaviour expectations.
